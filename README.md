# GooseInstaller

Run GooseInstaller.exe on any windows computer (including from an attached usb drive) to immediately install the DesktopGoose folder as a hidden folder in the target's desktop, add a shortcut to the GooseDesktop.exe file in their desktop to their Start-up folder, along with the DuplicateGoose.exe file. Should be unnoticeable except to targeted scrutiny. 

### Effects

Once installed, whenever the computer starts up, Desktop Goose and DuplicateGoose.exe will be activated automatically, creating a new copy of the GooseDesktop.exe shortcut, renamed with a timestamp to ensure no identically named files. This means each subsequent start-up will activate GooseDesktop.exe one more time than the previous time. 

To close all DesktopGoose instances, hold 'Escape' for several seconds.
